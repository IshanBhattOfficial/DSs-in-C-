# Data-Structures-in-C-
This repository is intended to serve as a resource for error-free implementations of all data structures


Hello. There are 3 ways in which you may contribute.
A. implement a new data structure.
  -there is no need for having menu / user-interface. just make sure all functions are there.
    -make sure you write the main() and provide sufficient test cases to handle all possibilities 
  -the list of remaining datastructures is there in a different file. Edit that too.
  -make sure you put your name and date
  -comment your code :)
B. debug/edit already existing codes
  -log this in too in comments with date
C. provide more test cases. Raise cases which may have been missed.
  -log these in a separate file too.

Adios. Happy Coding!
